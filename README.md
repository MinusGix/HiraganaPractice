This is a simple drag and drop game to practice identifying Hiragana. A clone of http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/hiragana-timer.html which was in flash, which made it rather hard to play on a modern browser.  
Made due to finding the above url on the tofugu japanese course, which so far is good (though I'm only on the beginning, obviously!), and wanting to be able to do it without flash.
